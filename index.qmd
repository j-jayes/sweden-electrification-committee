## Purpose

This document is written to explain the important parts of the reports of the Swedish Electrification Committee to digitize.

### Introduction

There are reports for 23 län and two summary reports in the folder on dropbox, and linked [here on GitHub](https://github.com/j-jayes/sweden-electrification-committee/tree/main/committee-reports-pdf) where you can download them.

The reports for each län on the electrification of rural areas contain:

- Introduction
- Description of current electrical installations
- Description of resources that remain to be tapped
- Analysis of the needs in the county and projection into the future
- Proposal for planned electrification
  - Sources of power
  - Local distribution
  - Costs of electrification
- Summary

At the end of the report is a map of the current distribution and a set of tables reporting the location and details of the power stations.

### Completeness

Some of the reports contain less information than others. Specifically, Gotland has less information because it is less electrified. Älvsborg contains a great deal of information, as does Halland (157 pages!).

### To digitize

It would be ideal to digitize the table specifying the generation capacity for each power station in the län. These tables are towards the end of each report.

An example is shown below for Gotland:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("snips", "Gotland_1.png"))
```

There is a template in excel for digitizing these tables available for download [here](https://github.com/j-jayes/sweden-electrification-committee/raw/main/Digitize-template.xlsx)

It looks like this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("snips", "digitize-template.png"))
```

### Maps

Here is an example of a ma containing the generation areas for each power station, as numbered on the tables. 

Potentially we could come back to these and extract the boundaries for each generation area.

It does not seem necessary for the moment.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("snips", "Gotland_map_1.png"))

```
